## Performance Testing (The DIY Approach)
```markdown
The performance testing is the tesing of how effective and responsive your program is.
 - the speed: how responsive/fast your app is
Testing techniques
  - memory and heap utilization
  - the number of effective app
  - application latency 
      (Note: latency means the delay before a transfer of data begins following an instruction 
      for its transfer)
Some software to use for testing
 - JVisualVM
 - JMeter
 - SoapUI
 - RoadRunner
```
## QA Testing (Quality Testing)
```markdown
All and only thing the QA test cares about is does your application works with the exact 
specifications that your client asked? QA tries to simulate what the user does.
```
